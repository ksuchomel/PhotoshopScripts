# PhotoshopScripts

Doing mundane tasks in Photoshop can be cumbersome. I have added Helper Scripts for Photoshop CS6 and newer versions.

PowerPngCssExport.jsx

Install Directions:
1) Download Script
2) Place in your Scripts folder where you have your Photoshop installed.
   For example: on the Mac it's at /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS6/Presets/Scripts
3) Make sure you restart Photoshop after copying the script

What PowerPngCssExport Does:
1) Merges all visible layers
2) Allows user to select output transparent PNG file name
3) Visible layers are merged and exported as transparent PNG
4) Pop-up window displays associated CSS markup for item that you can copy & paste into your CSS file!
5) All actions in Photoshop history are erased (no need to worry about stepping back)

To Use:
1) Only show layers you want merged & exported
2) Run File->Scripts->PowerPngCssExport
