# PhotoshopScripts

Doing mundane tasks in Photoshop can be cumbersome. I have added Helper Scripts for Photoshop CS6 and newer versions.

## PowerPngCssExport.jsx

**Install Directions:**<br>
1. Download Script<br>
2. Place in your Scripts folder where you have your Photoshop installed. For example: on the Mac it's at /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS6/Presets/Scripts<br>
3. Make sure you restart Photoshop after copying the script<br>

**What PowerPngCssExport Does:**<br>
1. Merges all visible layers<br>
2. Allows user to select output transparent PNG file name<br>
3. Visible layers are merged and exported as transparent PNG<br>
4. Generates CSS markup for selection/layer(s)<br>
5. CSS markup is copied to the clipboard for easy pasting into your CSS file<br>
6. Last history before export is restored (no need to worry about stepping back to clean up)<br>

**To Use:**<br>
1. Open your PSD file<br>
2. Only show layers you want merged & exported<br>
3. Optional: use selection tool to crop or expand selection area<br>
4. Select the Photoshop file menu: File->Scripts->Power PNG Export<br>
