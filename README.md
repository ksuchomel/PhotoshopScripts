# PhotoshopScripts

Doing mundane tasks in Photoshop can be cumbersome. I have added Helper Scripts for Photoshop CS6 and newer versions.

## PowerPngCssExport.jsx

**Install Directions:**<br>
1. Download Script<br>
2. Place in your Scripts folder where you have your Photoshop installed. For example: on the Mac it's at /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS6/Presets/Scripts<br>
3. Make sure you restart Photoshop after copying the script<br>

**What PowerPngCssExport Does:**
1. Merges all visible layers
2. Allows user to select output transparent PNG file name
3. Visible layers are merged and exported as transparent PNG
4. Generates CSS markup for selection/layer(s) and displays in dialog box
5. CSS markup is also copied to the clipboard for easy pasting into your CSS file
6. All actions in Photoshop history are erased (no need to worry about stepping back to clean up).

**To Use:**
1. Open your PSD file
2. Only show layers you want merged & exported
3. Optional: use selection tool to crop or expand selection area
4. Select the Photoshop file menu: File->Scripts->Power PNG Export
